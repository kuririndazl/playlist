I had plans for the weekend (Ah) <br>
But wound up with you instead <br>
Back here again (Oh) <br>
Got me deep in my feelings <br>
When I should be in your bed (Oh) <br>

You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever <br>
And you were there my lonely nights, yeah <br>
Keeping me together <br>
So wouldn't it make sense if I was yours? <br>
And you could call me your baby <br>
But we say we're just, say we're just <br>

Friends, just for now <br>
Yeah, but friends don't say words that <br>
Make friends feel like more than just <br>
Friends, just for now (Just for now) <br>
Now, I'm over pretending <br>
So let's put the "end" in friends <br>

Friends are not supposed to get too close <br>
And feel emotions that <br>
We're feeling now, now, now <br>
We ain't slowing down, down, down <br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
But once we cross the line <br>
There's no denying you and <br>
I can never turn around, 'round, 'round <br>
Know we'll never be the same (Ooh) <br>

You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever <br>
