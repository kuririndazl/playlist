We could go pop all the champagne in California <br>
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna <br>
Hypothetically, we (we) could do (do) <br>
Anything that we'd like <br>
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits <br>
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to <br>
We could spend every dime <br>
But I don't want (want) anything ('thing) <br>
But more time <br>
No matter what we do <br>
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing <br>
No ordinary things with you <br>
It's funny, but it's true <br>
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing <br>
As long as I'm with you <br>
You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day <br>
You hit like my biggest fan when I hear what the critiques say <br>
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late <br>
I don't need no diamonds, just your time <br>
No matter what we do <br>
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing <br>
No ordinary things with you <br>
It's funny, but it's true <br>
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing <br>
As long as I'm with you <br>
Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you <br>
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you <br>
And when he'd come home and I'd see him, when he first gets off that train <br>
It was like God almighty arrived <br>
It was like seein' daylight <br>
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times <br>
You know? It's not that we never fought <br>
You can overcome that <br>
You know? It-it's very easy <br>
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight <br>
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that <br>
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it <br>
You're in the wrong place, get out
