	<p class="parts">I am not a stranger to the dark <br>
"Hide away, " they say <br>
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts" <br>
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars <br>
"Run away, " they say <br>
"No one'll love you as you are" <br>
But I won't let them break me down to dust <br>
I know that there's a place for us <br>
For we are glorious <br>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out <br>
I am brave, I am bruised <br>
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me <br>
Look out 'cause here I come <br>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum <br>
I'm not scared to be seen <br>
I make no apologies, this is me <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh <br>
Another round of bullets hits my skin <br>
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in <br>
We are bursting through the barricades and <br>
Reaching for the sun (we are warriors) <br>
Yeah, that's what we've become (yeah, that's what we've become) <br>
I won't let them break me down to dust <br>
I know that there's a place for us <br>
For we are glorious <br>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out <br>
I am brave, I am bruised <br>
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me <br>
Look out 'cause here I come <br>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum <br>
I'm not scared to be seen <br>
I make no apologies, this is me <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh <br>
This is me <br>
and I know that I deserve your love <br>
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) there's nothing I'm not worthy of <br>
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh) <br>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out <br>
This is brave, this is bruised <br>
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me <br>
Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come) <br>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on) <br>
I'm not scared to be seen <br>
I make no apologies, this is me <br>
Whenever the words wanna cut me down (oh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
I'll send a flood to drown 'em out (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh) <br>
I'm gonna send a flood (oh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
Gonna drown them 'em out (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh) <br>
Oh <br>
This is me</p>
