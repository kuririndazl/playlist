	<p class="got">And you got me like, oh <br>
What you want from me? (What you want from me?) <br>
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high <br>
Baby you got me like, oh, mm <br>
You love when I fall apart (fall apart) <br>
So you can put me together <br>
And throw me against the wall <br>
Baby you got me like ah, woo, ah <br>
Don't you stop loving me (loving me) <br>
Don't quit loving me (loving me) <br>
Just start loving me (loving me) <br>
Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting with fire <br>
Just to get close to you <br>
Can we burn something, babe? <br>
And I run for miles just to get a taste <br>
Must be love on the brain <br>
That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way) <br>
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good <br>
And I can't get enough <br>
Must be love on the brain yeah <br>
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name) <br>
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you <br>
And I can't get enough <br>
Must be love on the brain <br>
Baby, keep loving me <br>
Just love me, yeah <br>
Just love me <br>
All you need to do is love me, yeah <br>
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow <br>
I'm tired of being played like a violin <br>
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart? <br>
Baby like ah, woo, ah <br>
Don't you stop loving me (loving me) <br>
Don't quit loving me (loving me) <br>
Just start loving me (loving me) <br>
Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire <br>
Just to get close to you <br>
Can we burn something, babe? <br>
And I run for miles just to get a taste <br>
Must be love on the brain <br>
That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way) <br>
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good <br>
And I can't get enough <br>
Must be love on the brain <br>
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name) <br>
No matter what I do <br>
I'm no good without you <br>
And I can't get enough <br>
Must be love on the brain</p>
