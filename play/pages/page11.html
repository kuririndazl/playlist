	<p class="rose">You gave me a rose sometime in June <br>
Back when our love was still fully in bloom <br>
That flower's now the only trace of you <br>
You became a ghost, someone I knew <br>
I've got nobody I can talk to <br>
'Cause everyone but me's forgotten you <br>
So now I take my car on these silent drives <br>
Because I hear our songs and it makes me cry <br>
And all my friends say all that you need is time <br>
And I hope they're right <br>
These lonely days keep passing by <br>
Try to live without your smile <br>
Even if it took a while, I'm almost over you <br>
The rose you gave me's dead and dry <br>
Losing one petal at a time <br>
Just like the memories in my mind <br>
I'm almost over you <br>
You're in my bones, under my skin <br>
I found the note in the pocket that you left it in <br>
A sketch of us, a penciled face <br>
We didn't know that things would all end up this way <br>
I take my car on these silent drives <br>
Because I hear our songs and it makes me cry <br>
And all my friends say all that you need is time <br>
And I hope they're right <br>
These lonely days keep passing by <br>
Try to live without your smile <br>
Even if it took a while, I'm almost over you <br>
The rose you gave me's dead and dry <br>
Losing one petal at a time <br>
Just like the memories in my mind <br>
I'm almost over you <br>
Almost over looking at your emerald eyes <br>
Almost over how your hand felt clutched to mine <br>
Almost over looking for your blue car every time I drive <br>
These lonely days keep passing by <br>
Try to live without your smile <br>
Even if it took a while, I'm almost over you <br>
The rose you gave me's dead and dry <br>
Losing one petal at a time <br>
Just like the memories in my mind <br>
I'm almost over you <br>
I'm almost over you <br>
Yeah, I'm almost over you <br>
I'm almost over you <br>
I'm almost over you</p>
